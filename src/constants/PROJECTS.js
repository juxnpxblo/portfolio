        "A simple chat app that uses the WebSocket protocol through the Socket.io library to make the real-time feature possible. It also has a simple register/login system, where the register component will check the user input while they're typing and will dynamically respond to errors on the client or server-side, when registering the user into the database.",

        "This was my attempt to replicate the Instagram's web app UI. I did the login, feed and profile interfaces. The one that I dedicated the most amount of time to was the login page, that has this cool fading effect on the iPhone screen on a loop â€” as it was implemented, you just need to place one image above the other (last to first) and choose a delay. It also has this other cool effect on the input's placeholder: it contracts on typing.",
